## Description
PawLog is a recommendation system that recommends a type of dog based on user preferences.

## How it Works
PawLog utilizes both Python and Prolog for this recommendation system. Python asks the user questions pertaining to dog ownership, and writes the input to a separate file which Prolog reads and, based on how it parses it, will return the top choice as well as 2 other dogs back to Python, which will print out these results. Python's main task is frontend, whereas Prolog's is backend.

This program is run through the terminal.

## IMPORTANT
Do NOT delete the text files generated during the program's run. Doing so could result in a possible loss of data.
